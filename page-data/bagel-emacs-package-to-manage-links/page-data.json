And I use a tablet for on-the-couch surfing.

So, the last couple of days I wrote an Emacs package that does just that automatically: <a href=\"https://github.com/vrind-nl/bag.el\">bag.el</a>.</p><p>It <a href=\"http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s02.html\">scratched an itch</a>, and I hope it may be useful for others.</p><p>Update 13 July, 2021: while I was at it, I also created <a href=\"https://github.com/vrind-nl/rav.el\">rav.el</a> (a unique password generator).</p></div>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/bagel-emacs-package-to-manage-links","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/still-learning"},"metadata":{"title":"Still learning","date":"July 8th, 2021","tags":["dev","productivity"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/bookmarks"},"metadata":{"title":"Bookmarks","date":"July 13th, 2021","tags":["emacs"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1056462243"]}
