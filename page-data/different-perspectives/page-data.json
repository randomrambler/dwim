To explain what I mean, the front cover of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach\">GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach</a> provides a perfect visualization.</p><p>We see three complex 3D wooden shapes that seemingly become simple 2D shapes when viewed from different angles. The viewers from the left see the letter E over G, the viewers from the right see the letter G over E, and the viewers from the top see the letter B.</p><p>Now envision all the discussions that will ensue. The viewers from the top are convinced there is Only One Letter (they could start a church), while the others will maintain there are two. The viewers from the left are sure the E is above the G, while the viewers from the right think it's the other way around, and the viewers from the top know for sure there is no G or E at all (in whatever order).</p><p>I think this abstract figure translates directly to reality. For example in a discussion between graphical designers, marketeers and software developers. More often than not, they actually agree, even though they embark on endless discussions.</p></div>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/different-perspectives","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/embedded-documents-in-mongodb"},"metadata":{"title":"Embedded Documents in Mongodb","date":"February 23rd, 2020","tags":["mongo","js"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/lets-talk"},"metadata":{"title":"Let's talk!","date":"February 28th, 2020","tags":["society"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1056462243"]}
