I ran Windows 10 and Ubuntu in dual-boot mode for years, but switching back-and-forth drove me crazy, so about a year ago I started using <a href=\"/windows-on-linux\">Windows on Linux</a> in a virtual machine.</p><p>But I still kept my Windows 10 dual-boot as fall-back, which meant Windows and Ubuntu had to share my 512GB storage. Windows was getting the lion share, because I had been unable to shrink its partition to less than about 270GB and I had the Windows VM on Linux which was gobbling up over 40GB extra of the Ubuntu partition (and growing), which left Ubuntu about 200GB.</p><p>The storage limitation was starting to annoy me. Mostly, because it kept me from installing Visual Studio on the Windows VM, without freeing space first. So, I decided to wipe my Windows partition and grow the Ubuntu one:</p><ol><li>The Windows partition was easily removed with the Ubuntu <code>disks</code> tool.</li><li>It turned out you can't resize a partition you're running from, so I made myself a <a href=\"https://gparted.org/livecd.php\">parted live USB</a> and booted from it. Which sounds easier than it actually was, because of <i>secure boot</i> issues, but in the end I managed to grow the Ubuntu partition.</li><li>And then nothing, because <a href=\"https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2\">GRUB</a> got lost along the way. The suggested <a href=\"https://gparted.org/display-doc.php?name=help-manual&#x26;lang=C#gparted-fix-grub-boot-problem\">solution</a> from the <code>parted</code> FAQ didn't solve it, but it did allow me to explore my file system. I found that I somehow trashed my <code>grub.cfg</code> (probably when I played around with <code>grub-install</code>), which left grub without a clue what to do. Restoring a backup solved that problem.</li></ol><p>Ubuntu now lives on a whopping 500GB partition, which hopefully extends the life-span of my laptop with at least another year or so.</p></div>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/i-bit-the-bullet","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/about-me"},"metadata":{"title":"About me","date":"June 11th, 2021","tags":["meta","private"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/0-is-true"},"metadata":{"title":"0 is true","date":"June 27th, 2021","tags":["emacs","dev"]}}}}}
