Shouldn't the point of IT be to <i>help</i> me grow? And why only <i>growth</i>?</p><p>When I work on Windows it feels as if it is always in my way. When I want to start working, it needs to update (which too often fails if my PC is older than 18 months). If I receive a document from someone else, it is in a newer version of Word than mine (granted, I am the one who chooses to keep using an 'old' version of Word). When I want to run Docker, I need to upgrade to Windows Pro. Etc, etc.</p><p>So one of the main reasons I use Open Source Software is that I feel liberated. Also in the beer and speech sense, but in this case I mean in the 'wearing comfortable shoes' sense.</p><p>It updates in the background and never fails. Therefore, I always have the latest (or at least a recent) version of every tool I use. And I can use Docker (or any other tool) any way I want.</p></div>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/low-expectations","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/virtual-machine-management"},"metadata":{"title":"Virtual Machine Management","date":"March 8th, 2020","tags":["sysop","vm"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/covid-19"},"metadata":{"title":"COVID-19","date":"March 23rd, 2020","tags":["society"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1056462243"]}
