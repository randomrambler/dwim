And I am still learning. Recently this has been mainly from studying other people's code.</p><p>For example, I work with highly technical code in C with lots of hardware interfaces and mathematical algorithms. The existing code is strictly organized and was written by a very disciplined developer. This level of structure and discipline helps me to write code like that myself.</p><p>As another example, I have been browsing through some code Emacs Lisp lately, like the very basic <a href=\"https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/simple.el\">simple.el</a>. As Emacs is \"self-documenting\", comments are an integral part of elisp to begin with, and developers have clearly taken care to explain their code where they saw fit. Although I think that comments can be <a href=\"https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/opinion/opinion-pieces/fighting-evil-code-comments-comments/\">evil</a> at worst and are a code-smell at best, good comments can be really valuable, and I can learn from the way Emacs modules have been documented.</p></div>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/still-learning","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/0-is-true"},"metadata":{"title":"0 is true","date":"June 27th, 2021","tags":["emacs","dev"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/bagel-emacs-package-to-manage-links"},"metadata":{"title":"bag.el: Emacs package to manage links","date":"July 12th, 2021","tags":["org","emacs"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1056462243"]}
