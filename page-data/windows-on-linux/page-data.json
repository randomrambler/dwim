Switching between OSs this way is a pain, but the best I could get for a long time. Worse, the dual-boot configuration seems to hamper the Windows update process, so my Windows 10 version was beginning to get outdated.</p><p>Previously I have considered:</p><ul><li>Running Windows 10 in a VM on a Ubuntu host with an illegal version of Windows (which I object to) or buying an extra license (which feels stupid, because my laptop came with Windows pre-installed).</li><li>Running Ubuntu in a VM on a Windows host, which felt like adding insult to injury.</li></ul><p><a href=\"/virtual-machine-management\">Recently</a> I rediscovered Qemu, which rekindled my interest in virtual machines (which I had sort of written off since my switch from Vagrant to Docker). But from Apple users I heard of <a href=\"https://www.parallels.com/\">Parallels</a> and how conveniently it merged the MacOS and Windows environments, so I started considering getting a MacBook. But I didn't want to give up on Linux just yet.</p><p>And then I found <a href=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-install-windows-10-in-a-vm-on-a-linux-machine/\">this</a> article, which pointed me to the <code>acpica-tools</code>. With it, you can retrieve your Windows 10 product key. So now I simply did:</p><ol><li>install Qemu and virt-manager</li><li>download Windows 10 ISO straight from Microsoft</li><li>install  <code>acpica-tools</code> and acquire product key</li><li>install Windows 10 in VM</li></ol><p>This has the added benefit that I now have an up-to-date install of Windows 10 without any bloatware.</p></div>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/windows-on-linux","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/covid-19-and-pareto"},"metadata":{"title":"COVID-19 and Pareto","date":"May 16th, 2020","tags":["society"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/covid-19-how-it-adds-up"},"metadata":{"title":"COVID-19: How it adds up","date":"February 24th, 2021","tags":["society"]}}}}}
