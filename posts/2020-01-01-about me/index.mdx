I am a software engineer, living in the Netherlands. I was born almost 50 years ago. I am a father of two beautiful daughters. We live together with my girlfriend and her two sons.

I develop software; mostly websites, but also the occasional CLI or daemon. [Python](https://www.python.org/) has long been my go to programming language, but I find I am moving more and more towards [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). Lately I am even drawn to [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/).

I prefer _open technologies_: I use open source software (OSS) whenever I can. And practically the only times that I can't involve working together with others on Microsoft Office documents. My preferred tools include:

- [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/), but sometimes I need to work on Windows. Therefore, all my tools preferably work on both.
- I bounce back and forth between [Emacs](https://emacs.org) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for code editing.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/doc) for version management and [Github](https://github.com/otech-nl) for sharing my code, issue management, and (Kanban) boards.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for managing development environments when [pipenv](https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) are not enough.
- [org-mode](orgmode.org) and sometimes [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) for plain text editing.

Have a look at [this](/2020-01-12-blog/) blog post to find out how I set up this blog.
