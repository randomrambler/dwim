The [Peter Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle) states:

> people in a hierarchy tend to rise to their "level of incompetence"

It boils down to this: when you are competent at your job, you are promoted until you're _not_ competent anymore.

I think something similar holds for software development. We increase the ambition of our software projects until we're no longer comfortable to build it.
