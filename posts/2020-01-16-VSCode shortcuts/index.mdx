As [indicated](/2020-01-01-about%20me) I bounce back and forth between [Emacs](https://emacs.org) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for coding.

Current editors like VSCode are just more modern. Many things are so much easier. And the main selling feature of Emacs, "_the [extensible, customizable](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html) editor_", is now also available in editors [like](https://www.sublimetext.com/) VSCode. You have a virtually unlimited choice of plugins and can relatively easily program your own. In Javascript. And not [elisp](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/elisp/)[^1].

[^1]: Lisp is an elegant language, but just not for everyone.

The one thing[^2] that keeps driving me back to Emacs is that the key bindings are in my muscle memory. To outsiders they seem archaic and mysterious, but to me they feel comfortable and homey. When I just _think_ of opening a file, my fingers want to go `Ctrl-X Ctrl-F`. And Emacs allows me to mostly stay away from the mouse, which saves me time and context switches.

[^2]: Well... actually _one_ of the things, but that's for another post.

Today I read [this post](https://dev.to/devmount/23-lesser-known-vs-code-shortcuts-as-gif-80) and it hit me that I could try to learn shortcuts in VSCode like I did in Emacs. I am sure that many of the things I do with the keyboard in Emacs can also be done in VSCode. So, I will try to add one shortcut every day to my repertoire.

To get me going, these are some useful resources:

* `Ctrl-K Ctrl-R` in VSCode opens the keyboard reference for your platform
* `Ctrl-K Ctrl-S` in VSCode opens the [keyboard shortcuts editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings) which initially shows the list of all defined key bindings
* `Ctrl-Shft-P` opens the searchable command palette, which shows keyboard shortcuts for every command
* Type `tips` in the command palette, and you get [Help, Tips & Tricks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks)
