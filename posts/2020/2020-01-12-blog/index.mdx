So, another attempt to start a blog.

I have been looking for a platform to blog. It should support...

* templates, features,
* tags,
* history and
* search. 

On the technical side, I want it to...

* be open source, 
* allow me to edit the posts locally in any editor I please (which requires flat-file input),
* support Markdown and (preferably) Org-mode input,
* deploy to Github Pages (which requires output a static site (i.e. without backend))

I have looked into Nikola, org-publish, Jeckyll and the likes, but never really liked in.

So now I have decided to see if I can start one from scratch, based on Gatsby:

1. I started off with this factastic tutorial.
2. I added a [Github workflow](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/configuring-a-workflow) inspired by [gatsby-starter-olga](https://github.com/orgapp/gatsby-starter-orga/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml)
