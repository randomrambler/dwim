So, another attempt to start a blog.

I have been looking for a platform to blog. It should support...

* templates,
* tags,
* history and
* search. 

On the technical side, I want it to...

* be open source, 
* allow me to edit the posts locally in any editor I please (which requires flat-file input),
* support Markdown and (preferably) Org-mode input,
* deploy to Github Pages (which requires output a site without backend))

I have looked into Nikola, org-publish, Jeckyll and the likes, but never really liked in.

So now I have decided to see if I can start one from scratch, based on Gatsby:

1. I started off with this [fantastic tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-developer-blog-from-scratch-with-gatsby-and-mdx/).
2. I added a [Github pages publish workflow](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-github-pages) (inspired by [gatsby-starter-olga](https://github.com/orgapp/gatsby-starter-orga/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml)). I also needed to [create a personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) and [store it as a secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets)
